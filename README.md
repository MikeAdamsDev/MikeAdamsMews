ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m __@MikeAdamsDev__ (formerly __@MikeAdamsMews__)

Iâ€™m interested in ...
- Technical documentation
- APIs and integrations
- Travel & hospitality
- Leveraging the power of AI

ðŸŒ± I'm currently developing a Blog site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and re-aligning my personal IT having gone from owning one MacBook to three in the space of a week.

ðŸ“· I'm also a photographer and have just returned from an event with 1800 images to process. That presented its own IT challenges, since I couldn't take a Mac on location and had to back up image files to an SSD using my Android smartphone and a powered hub.
It turns out those universal UK-to-EU adapters don't work in Sicily (aagh!), and my new media card reader didn't recognise one of the new SD cards (aaargh!). Isn't it interesting that almost every technical problem â€“ in both hardware and software â€“ seems to come down to __integration standards__.
